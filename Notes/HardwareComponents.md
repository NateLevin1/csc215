# 1. Hardware Components

-   Terminal = the device used to connect to the computer
-   CP/M programs have a specified name
-   Computer programmers != computer operators
-   Console/Terminal <-> Computer (which has CPU and Memory) <-> Peripherals (floppy disk back and forth, line printer out)
-   Early computers had operator consoles with lights, switches, and patch cords for program input. Like the Altair
-   TTY was used as input/output. Replaced by CRT and electric keyboard
-   Computer sizes vary: mainframes, mega-minis, minicomputers, microcomputers.
-   CPU was initially a separate rack with circuit boards, later integrated circuits reduced size.
-   Intel 8080 instruction set became standard - CP/M was written in this
-   Instructions are stored in memory (RAM)
-   ROM = Read Only Memory
-   PROM = Programmable ROM
-   65k of memory
-   Disks store data in tracks and sectors
-   Line printer will be used for input/output
-   Floppy disks are used for storage
-   Modem is used to connect to other computers
-   This book will teach us about assembly programming with CP/M
